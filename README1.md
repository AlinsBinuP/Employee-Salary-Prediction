# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether an employee earns **more than 50K** annually based on demographic and work-related features using Machine Learning.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing using pandas and NumPy
- Model training using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Deployment using Streamlit + Ngrok for web-based prediction
- Real-time user input and batch CSV prediction

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Streamlit
- Pyngrok

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- [Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)

## 🛠 How to Run the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

If you're running on Google Colab, use `pyngrok` to tunnel your Streamlit app.

## 📎 Files Included
- `Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb` – Colab notebook with preprocessing & model training
- `app.py` – Streamlit app interface
